# MemoryScape_Team13

## Project Details 
- Project Name: MemoryScape
- Trailer Video link: 
- Project Description:
Memoryscape is a mixed-reality environment that aims to help patients suffering from cognitive impairments, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, to improve memory retention by creating memory-based routines. Our project is based on the concept of “memory palaces”, a mental technique for information retention. The core of the idea centres around associating information with specific, familiar locations and objects in a physical space. We’ve implemented this concept in an interactive mixed-reality setting. Specifically, our demo implementation involves navigation between objects, where each object is associated with a sound and a memory task (e.g. remembering to take medication or remembering emergency contact info). The goal of the task is that patients would form cognitive associations between the object, sound and location, strengthening the memory and enabling the user to retain and access that information more easily. Studies suggest that we are more likely to remember information if we associate it with different senses such as vision, sound and touch. Accessibility was evidently a salient aspect of this project, especially for users that might be movement-impaired or have motion-sensitivity issues, so we prioritised a relaxing experience with minimal movement, no teleportation or passive locomotion as well as calming background music. The XR aspect is also well-suited to the needs of our target audience, as allowing them to be in a familiar environment decreases the potential stress and confusion associated with the experience.
