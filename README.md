## MemoryScape

- Project Description:

Memoryscape is a mixed-reality environment that aims to help patients suffering from cognitive impairments, such as dementia and Alzheimer's disease, to improve memory retention by creating memory-based routines. Our project is based on the concept of “memory palaces”, a mental technique for information retention. The core of the idea centres around associating information with specific, familiar locations and objects in a physical space. We’ve implemented this concept in an interactive mixed-reality setting. Specifically, our demo implementation involves navigation between objects, where each object is associated with a sound and a memory task (e.g. remembering to take medication or remembering emergency contact info). The goal of the task is for patients to establish cognitive links between their memories and specific objects, sounds, and locations. These connections are intended to enhance memory retention and recall. Research has shown that information becomes more memorable when it is tied to events or significant sensory experiences, including vision, sound, and touch. 

We prioritise accessibility in this project, specifically, for users that might be triggered by sudden visual and auditory change. We accommodate their needs by providing a relaxing experience with calm background music and no teleportation or sudden movement. The XR aspect is also well-suited to the needs of our target audience, as allowing them to be in a familiar environment decreases the potential stress and confusion associated with the experience. Moreover, XR is interactive so it can also help improve motor control and coordination in neurological patients. Overall, our software aims to increase resilience in completing otherwise simple day-to-day tasks for such patients.

## Setup
### Requirements:
To try Memoryscape, users will need a Meta Quest 3 headset, which provides the necessary mixed-reality environment. The Memoryscape application, available on the Oculus Store, must be installed on the headset. A Wi-Fi connection is required for downloading the app and updates. No additional hardware is needed beyond the headset and its controllers. It's also suggested to have a clear physical space for safe navigation during use.

### Instructions:
To start using Memoryscape, charge and power on your Meta Quest 3 headset. Download Memoryscape into the headset. The app includes a basic tutorial to get users acquainted with its features and controls. Adjustments for comfort, such as background music volume and control sensitivity, can be made in the app's settings. Memoryscape is designed to be accessible, requiring minimal physical movement and allowing users to navigate and interact with the environment using the headset's controllers.
